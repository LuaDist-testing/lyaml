lyaml NEWS - User visible changes

* Noteworthy changes in release 4 (2013-09-11) [beta]

** New Features:

  - New yaml.emitter API returns an object with an emit method for
    adding events using yaml_*_event_initialize() calls.

  - New yaml.parser API returns a Lua iterator that fetches the next
    event using yaml_parser_parse().

  - New yaml.scanner API returns a Lua iterator that fetches the next
    token using yaml_parser_scan().

  - Beginnings of Specl specs, starting with a reasonably comprehensive
    specifications for the new APIs above.

  - C implementation of lyaml.dump has moved to Lua implementation as
    yaml.dump.

  - C implementation of lyaml.load has moved to Lua implementation as
    yaml.load.

  - The new Lua implementation of lyaml.load () handles multi-document
    streams, and returns a table of documents when the new second
    argument is `true`.

** This release is functionally identical to the last.

** New Features:

  - lyaml builds are now made against Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2 and luajit 2.0.0

* Noteworthy changes in release 2 (2013-03-18) [beta]

* Noteworthy changes in release 1 (2013-03-17) [beta]

** New Features:

  - A binding for libYAML, by Andrew Danforth:  Updated for Lua 5.1 and
    5.2, and packaged as a luarock.

  - I spun this out of Specl (http://github.com/gvvaughan/specl) so that
    other projects may use it, and to simplify the Specl build.

** Known Issuse:

  - There's not really any documentation, sorry.  Contributions welcome!
